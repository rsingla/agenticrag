Key Takeaways\\nUnderstanding Scalability\\nScalability, whether in a financial context or within the context of business strategy, refers to an organization\\'s ability to grow without being hampered by its structure or available resources when faced with increased production. What Is Scalability?\\nScalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) defines it as having \"an average annualized growth greater than 20% a year, over a 3-year period, and with 10 or more employees at the beginning of the observation period.\" \"\\nExample of Scalability in the Tech Sector\\nSome tech companies have an amazing ability to scale quickly, putting them in the coveted category of\\xa0high-growth enterprises.'},\n",
